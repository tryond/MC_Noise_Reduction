# Monte Carlo Rendering Noise Reduction

MC Rendering Noise Reduction is a program which implements several different filtering techniques for use with reducing noise generated by Monte Carlo Path Tracing renderings of 3D scenes.

## Description

Monte Carlo Path Tracing casts a ray from the viewer perspective out through each pixel in the frame. Each ray reflects off the objects in the scene a specified amount of times and returns a value for its respective pixel. As one can imagine, this operation can take a very long time to complete. This is compounded by the fact that Monte Carlo Renderings generally require many samples-per-pixels to produce clean results. 

The purpose of this project is to attain the results of a scene generated using high samples-per-pixel by applying post-processing filters to their low sample counterparts. 

Goals:
1. Reduce overall noise
2. Maintain or improve upon time complexity
3. Maintain or improve upon visual results
4. Gain insights that could help us move towards real-time path tracing

## Motivation

MC Rendering Noise Reduction was created as my senior project in **CS114: Projects in Advanced 3D Computer Graphics** at University of California, Irvine.

## Instructions

### Compile

Console compile command:

```console
mc-noise-reduce <username>$ g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -fopenmp -o simplept RNG.cpp Vec.cpp SimpleFilter.cpp ObjectFilter.cpp BrdfFilter.cpp NormalFilter.cpp DofFilter.cpp simplept.cpp
```

### Run

Console run command:

```console
mc-noise-reduce <username>$ simplept X a b c d e f g h i j k l m n
```

**Replace each letter in the run command with an intenger >= 0**

* **X**: samples-per-pixel

**The following lower-case letters refer to filter types. The number designated refers to the size of the filter. Setting a filter to zero will turn the filter off entirely.**

A full write-up describing each filter can be found [here](https://tryond.github.io/noise_red.html).

* **a**: simple mean parameter

* **b**: simple median parameter

* **c**: simple gaussian parameter

* **d**: object mean parameter

* **e**: object median parameter

* **f**: object gaussian parameter

* **g**: brdf mean parameter

* **h**: brdf gaussian parameter

* **i**: normal mean parameter

* **j**: normal gaussian parameter

* **k**: dof mean level parameter

* **l**: dof mean focus level parameter

* **m**: dof gray level parameter

* **n**: dof gray focus level parameter

### Example

The following command will generate a 64 sample-per-pixel rendering which applies both a 7 pixel wide simple median filter and a 3 pixel wide simple gaussian filter. 

```console
mc-noise-reduce <username>$ simplept 64 0 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
